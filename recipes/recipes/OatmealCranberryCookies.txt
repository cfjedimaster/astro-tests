Ingredients: 
	1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (180g)
	1 teaspoon baking soda
	1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	3/4 teaspoon salt
	1 cup unsalted butter (at room temperature (2 sticks)
	1 cup packed light brown sugar (220g)
	1/4 cup granulated sugar (50g)
	2 large eggs (at room temperature)
	1 teaspoon vanilla extract
	3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (336g)
	1 1/2 cups sweetened dried cranberries (6oz/170g bag)
Instructions: 
	Preheat the oven to 350F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
	In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
	In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter and sugars on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until just combined after each addition. Stop to scrape down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla until just combined.
	With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture until just combined. Scrape down the bowl. Beat in the oats and cranberries just until combined.
	Using a 1 1/2-inch spring-loaded scoop or spoons, scoop the dough onto the lined baking sheets, about 1 1/2-inches apart. Bake 1 tray at a time until lightly browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the pan for 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
