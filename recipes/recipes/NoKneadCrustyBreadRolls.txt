Ingredients: 
	3 cups bread, strong white or plain flour
	1 tbsp yeast
	1 tsp salt
	1.5 cups warm water (ensure it’s not too hot)
Instructions: 
	Add all the ingredients to a bowl and mix until you have a wet, sticky dough. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and leave to rise for 1 hour. It should now have doubled in size with bubbles on the surface. You can leave it longer if you wish.
	Using a spoon bring the edges in until it roughly forms a large ball. Then dust a surface with some flour and scrap the dough on to the surface. Using your hands, spoon or bread scraper, gently form a ball. Do not over fold and do not knead. You want the dough to be slightly loose so do not add more flour. Divide into 6 and form into smaller balls. Place them on some parchment paper and Leave to rest for a further 15mins on the countertop. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 230c.
	Place a dutch oven or an oven proof pan in the oven and leave to heat up for 10mins.
	Remove the pot from the oven and place the parchment paper and dough inside. Now cover. This is important. Try to cover with an oven save lid or another bowl on top rather than foil. Even a baking sheet will work. Bake for 30mins. Now remove the lid and continue to bake for 10mins. Remove from oven, leave to rest until its no longer too hot before you cut it. This will prevent it going gummy! Enjoy!
